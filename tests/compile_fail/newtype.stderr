   = note: expected struct `ReturnResponseMustUse<String, UniqueType<{closure@$DIR/src/lib.rs:661:56: 661:58}>>`
              found struct `ReturnResponseMustUse<String, UniqueType<{closure@$DIR/src/lib.rs:661:56: 661:58}>>`
   = note: no two closures, even if identical, have the same type
   = help: consider boxing your closure and/or using it as a trait object
